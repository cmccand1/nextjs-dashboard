# Code Style Guidelines

## Tools

- `pnpm run prettier`: Format all project files.
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`: Automatically sorts Tailwind CSS classes.

## Rules

- **Formatting**: Always run `pnpm run prettier` AFTER you're done making changes.
- **Consistency**: Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions found in the project.
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new components and logic. Ensure types are correctly defined in `app/lib/definitions.ts` or locally where appropriate.
